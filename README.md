# The Odin Project - Foundations
# Project #3: Etch-a-Sketch

**Goal**: Create an interactive sketch pad allowing users to draw within a grid in a chosen style. This exercise can be found in The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## Phase 1: Create a working sketch pad
At this point, the exercise requirements (+optional) are fulfilled:
- Grid cells are colored with a random hue on hover
- Cells are slightly darkened on rehover
- Reset button clears any drawing on sketch pad and prompts users to input number of squares to fill one side of grid
- On receiving valid input from user, a new grid is created with desired dimensions
- **All cells in new grid continue to be square in dimension**
- **New grid occupies same pixels on screen as before**
